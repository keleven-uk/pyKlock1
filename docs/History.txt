Previous versions of Klock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of Klock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	Klock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finaly settled on pySimpleGUI.  Most complete.
	Klock 1 - CustomTkinter  [this]
	Klock 2 - Flet.

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)


V2024.9		[25 September 2024]

	Added a new option under Help - License.
		This option loads the license text file into a text box for display.
	Added a screen shot of klock to the read.me file.
	Klock does not run un 3.13.rc2 yes - pywin32 not compatible.


V2024.8     [24 September 2024]

	Added a new option under Help - History.
		This option loads the history text file into a text box for display.


V2024.7     [25 September 2024]

	Because of the slight problem with the Segmented buttons below - decided to implement the menus.
		Current menus -
			File - exit
			Edit - colour [launches the colour picker]
			Help - About  [not yet implemented]
		The Segmented menu buttons have been removed, but not the file.
	Also removed the Segmented button from the colour chooser window and implanted option is single buttons.

	Passes ruff check .
	Compiles to executable using pyInstaller.
	Using python 3.12.6 and CustonTKinter 5.2.2.


V2024.6     [23 Septemebr 2024]

	Found an example of a dropdown menu at https://github.com/Akascape/CTkMenuBar.
	Added the example to Klock - lives in src.menu.py.
	Not sure if I will use it, so added a option menu visible - set to false.


V2024.5     [23 September 2024]

	Added a colour chooser for the foreground and background.
		Colour picker used is from https://github.com/Akascape/CTkColorPicker.
		This opens in a new windows, with option of Apply, Reset and Cancel - lives in src.windows.SelectColourWindow.py.
		Apply, writes the new colours to config.toml.
		Reset, reverts to foreground of green and a background of black.  N.B. need to apply.
		Cancel - closes the window.

	Found a problem with the Segmented Button used in the main and colour picker menu.
		The same option can not be selected twice, need to select an other first then return.


V2024.4	    [14 September 2024]

	Load and saves options to a config file - config.toml.
		Option are - App Name, App Version.
		             App X position, App Y position - SO, the screen location is remembered and re-used.
		             App width and height - cannot be changed at the moment.
		             Foreground colour and background colour - cannot be changed at the moment.

	Added pyinstaller.jason so that auto-py-to-exe.exe can do it's stuff.
		Needs to be to a directory and not a single file, because CustomTKinter says so.


V2024.3     [13 September 2024]

	Using tkinter direct commands to
		Remove the default title bar.
		Make the main window transparent - current transparent colour is black [still hard wired].
		Make the app always on top.
		Drag the app when left mouse click on the main time text.
	Added an Exit option to the menu buttons.


V2024.2     [12 September 2024]

	Completed the update of the status bar.
		The status bar shows the date, the status of Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and Num Lock, idle time of the PC.
		The three elements of the status bat are laid out okay, but not ideal.
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.
	Changed the font for the main time to be The Display St - it looks better especially since it is monospaced.
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.
	Changed the position of the menu buttons to be at the top centre of the app
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.

	The colours are hard coded for the moment as is the font.


V2024.1		[9 September 2024]

	Basic implementation of Klock.
	The app is created in python [3.12.6] using the Customtkinter [5.2.2] GUI framework.
	The app displays the current time in the format HH:MM:SS.
	The app consists of the following -
		Menu buttons [Type - Colour - Font]   - displayed, not yet implemented.
		Current time
		Status Bar [Date - Status - Idle Time]- displayed, not yet implemented.
