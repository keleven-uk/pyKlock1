Previous versions of Klock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of Klock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	Klock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finaly settled on pySimpleGUI.  Most complete.
	Klock 1 - CustomTkinter  [this]
	Klock 2 - Flet.


V2024.2     [12 September 2024]

	Completed the update of the status bar.
		The status bar shows the date, the status of Caps Lock, Scroll Lock and Num Lock, idle time of the PC.
		The three elements of the status bat are laid out okay, but not ideal.
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.
	Changed the font for the main time to be The Display St - it looks better especially since it is monospaced.
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.
	Changed the position of the menu buttons to be at the top centre of the app
		The background is set to black and the foreground colour is green.

	The colours are hard coded for the moment as is the font.


V2024.1		[9 September 2024]

	Basic implementation of Klock.
	The app is created in python [3.12.6] using the Customtkinter [5.2.2] GUI framework.
	The app displays the current time in the format HH:MM:SS.
	The app consists of the following -
		Menu buttons [Type - Colour - Font]   - displayed, not yet implemented.
		Current time
		Status Bar [Date - Status - Idle Time]- displayed, not yet implemented.
