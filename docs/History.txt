Previous versions of Klock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of Klock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

	Klock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finally settled on pySimpleGUI.  Most complete.
	Klock 1 - CustomTkinter  [this]
	Klock 2 - Flet.

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)


V2024.24	[30 October]

	Merged vfd branch into the main branch.
	Updated requirements.txt and requirements_dev.txt
	Built stand alone executable and installer from main.

	Their was a few problem with creating the executable.
		PyMuPDF [used to display help in pdf format] failed in the executable, but worked in
		the python script.  This was found to be a problem in the currect version [1.24.12],
		installed previous version [1.24.10] - all now okay

		tkVFD [used in vfdKlock] also failed in the executable but worked in the python script.
		This was found to be tkVFD using a different path in the executable then the script
		for it's graphic files.  I cured this by creating the desired path in the executable.


V2024.23	[28 October]

	in vfd branch.

	Found Vacuum Fluorescent Displays for tk when looking for other things.
		See Help [Credits Section] for location and original author.
		Added config options for vfdKlock, screen location and colour only used.
	This is used in the first of the alternative Klocks.
	When this Klock is displayed, the main Klock is minimised to the task bar.

	Changed the status bar [again] to try and fix the layout problems.
	The status bar is now one long label and not three as before.
	This makes the logic and settings a lot easier - will see.

	Corrected a bug in the screen position locator of the main window.

	Added a new time type - getDigitTime - returns current time as a list [H,H,M,M,S,S]
		Used in vfdKlock


V2024.22	[23 October]

	Merged friends branch into the main branch.
	Updated requirements.txt and requirements_dev.txt
	Built stand alone executable and installer from main.


V2024.21	[21 October]

	In friends branch [Using python 3.12.7 and CustonTKinter 5.2.2].

	Added two new windows, one to display the current friends and a second to add a new friend.
	The display friends window is called from the main menu, there is an Add button to add a friend.
	The friends are saved in a csv file [for the moment] in the data directory.
	No validation is done on the data entry - will add as needed.

	Need to add the edit and delete buttons to the friends window.
	Need to test before merging into main.

	Also added a sperate version file in the data directory.
		This allows the version in an installed Klock to be updated without uninstalling first.
		The install process doesn't upgrade the existing config file.

	Note : in addition to installing the files in the requirements files, the following source
	       directories need to be added, see Help [Credits Section] for GitHub addresses.
	       CTkDatePicker, CTkPDFViewer & CTkXYFrame


V2024.20	[16 October 2024]

	New GIT branch friends - to build the friends accessory.

	Added two new windows - showFriends and showAddFriends.
		One contains a scrollable frame to show all of the friends and the other allows the input of a friend.
		The showFriends is called from the main menu, which then calls the showAddFriends window.
	Added a new class friend, to hold the friend data - this will be added to a directory store.
	Added menu option Accessories / Friends.


V2024.19	[8 October 2024]

	Switched off the saving of the window size, so if the window is stretched because of a long time text - it isn't saved.
	I couldn't get the status bar to line correctly.  I wanted the date on the left side, the status in the middle and the
	idle time at the far right.  I reverted to padding the string with spaces depending on the width of the window.
	I know this is a bit klunky - will re-visit if I find a better way.
	Also added config option to specify the font for the status bat - default is the "default" text.


V2024.18	[6 October 2024]

	Further amened below, so that when the windows is dynamically resized the keeps to the right hand side of the screen.
	This can be switched off in the config.toml file - but default to True [I Like it].
		When the X position is changed the gain alignment, the Y position is left unchanged.
	Cleaned up the imports in klock_utils.py.


V2024.17	[2 October 2024]

	Amended both the main window and the time type window to expand dynamical when needed.
	So, setting the size which produces a time text that wont fit in the window, the window expands.


V2024.16	[3 October 2024]

	Added a new option under edit - Time Types.
		This allows the time format to be chosen for a list of supplied time formats.
		The different formats are held in src.select time.  [Used in all version of python Klock].
		When the menu option is chosen, a new windows opens allowing the user to select the time type and size.
		The time type and size in the config is also changed, so the main time will change in real time.


V2024.15	[2 October 2024]

	Tried to make an installed and a stand alone executable with auto-py-to-exe.exe and Inno setup Compiler.
	The stand alone executable has worked for some version, but when installed on the PC there was an error.
	The error was dur to windows not letting the loc files be created in the same directory as the .exe.
	The solution is to store the log files in C:\Users\kevin\AppData\Local\Keleven\Klock\Logs or similar.
	Also, store the config in a similar place : C:\Users\kevin\AppData\Local\Keleven\Klock
	Once auto-exe-to-py has done it's stuff, copyStuff.bat needs to run.
		This copies required files into the output/klock directory [where the .exe lives]
	The the Inno setup script needs to be run in the output/klock directory and hey presto an installer is produced.


V2024.14	[30 September 2024]

	Added a new option under Edit - Font.
		Allows the user to select a new font using the tk font chooser - https://tkfontchooser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
		For now, only font name and size can be selected.
		This only allows a font size to 30, amending the line 102 in tkfontchooser.pt to 102 is better.


V2024.13	[30 Septemebr 2024]

	Changed the help loading system - now used a customTKwindow to display.
		Uses the pdf viewer - https://github.com/Akascape/CTkPDFViewer.
		The source needs to be included in the src directory.


V2024.12	[29 September 2024]

	Added a new option under Help - Help.
		This option loads Klock's help in pdf format.
		The pdf file is loaded by whatever your system loads pdf files.
		The help file is generated using HelpNDoc - .pdf & .chm files are generated.


V2024.11	[29 September 2024]

	Corrected a bug where the licence and history files did not load.
		This was a logic error in the text file read bit.
	Wrapped the text file load bits and the timer call in try ... exception.

	Added a new option under Help - License.
		This option loads the license text file into a text box for display.
	Added a screen shot of klock to the read.me file.

V2024.7     [25 September 2024]

	Because of the slight problem with the Segmented buttons below - decided to implement the menus.
		Current menus -
			File - exit
			Edit - colour [launches the colour picker]

		The Segmented menu buttons have been removed, but not the file.
	Also removed the Segmented button from the colour chooser window and implanted option is single buttons.

	Passes ruff check .
	Compiles to executable using pyInstaller.
	Using python 3.12.6 and CustonTKinter 5.2.2.


V2024.6     [23 Septemebr 2024]

	Found an example of a dropdown menu at https://github.com/Akascape/CTkMenuBar.
	Added the example to Klock - lives in src.menu.py.
	Not sure if I will use it, so added a option menu visible - set to false.


V2024.5     [23 September 2024]

	Added a colour chooser for the foreground and background.
		Colour picker used is from https://github.com/Akascape/CTkColorPicker.
		This opens in a new windows, with option of Apply, Reset and Cancel - lives in src.windows.SelectColourWindow.py.
		Apply, writes the new colours to config.toml.
		Reset, reverts to foreground of green and a background of black.  N.B. need to apply.
		Cancel - closes the window.

	Found a problem with the Segmented Button used in the main and colour picker menu.
		The same option can not be selected twice, need to select an other first then return.
