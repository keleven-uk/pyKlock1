pyKlock2.

Previous versions of Klock have existed in VB.net, Lazarus [Free Pascal] and Free Basic - and may again.

Current version of Klock is written in Python using different GUI frameworks

    Klock 0 - pygubu & pySimpleGUI - finaly settled on pySimpleGUI.  Most complete.
    Klock 1 - CustomTkinter
    Klock 2 - Flet.

A mini klock built using CuistomTKinter.

Using python 3.12 and CustonTKinter 5.2.2.

Note : I use the correct spelling of colour on my side of the code.  :-)



The Klock displays the time [local], date, key status and the computers idle time.
 Key status is the status of Caps Lock, Scroll lock and Num lock.


The foreground and background colours can be selected.

The Klock is moved by dragging the displayed time.

The Klock currently has a transparent background.

The Klock should remain on top of other other windows.
